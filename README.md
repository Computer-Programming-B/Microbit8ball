micro:bit 8 ball
--------------------
In this assignment you will simulate the Magic 8-ball toy that was invented in the USA in the 1950s. Shaped like an oversized pool ball, you ask it a question like ‘will I be rich and famous one day?’, shake the ball and one of 20 different answers randomly appear in a window. Answers can be positive, negative - or somewhere in between. This program simulates a Magic 8-ball using the micro:bit’s accelerometer, its ability to make random numbers and its LED display output to show a tick for yes, a cross for no or a ‘meh’ face for ‘not sure’. The program generates a random number between 1 and 3 then uses `if` `elif` `else` statements to make different symbols appear depending on the number. If the number is 3, it shows a tick for ‘yes’. If the number is 2, it shows a cross for ‘no’.vThe program doesn’t need to check if the number is 1, because if it’s not 3 or 2, it must be 1, in which case it shows a ‘meh’ face for ‘not sure.’

Program requirements
-----------------
* Your program must use at least three original images for the 3 possible answers
* Shaking the micro:bit will generate a random answer
* Submit both the Python code and an animated gif showing your program running to Google Classroom
